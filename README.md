This project is a group coursework assignment for the Software Engineering Methods module. It is a Java application that connects to a MySQL database to generate various reports about the world's countries, cities, populations, and languages.

The application follows a clean architecture with a separation of concerns into data models, Data Access Objects (DAO), and report generation layers. The entire environment is containerized using Docker and managed with Docker Compose for easy setup and execution.
